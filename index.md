<h1 align="center">Introdcution</h1>

I am a third year student, studying BIT at the University of Pretoria. I have an incredible passion for Computer Science as well as photography and I take great pride in the work that I do. I have an innate drive and apply myself fully to all the work that I do. I have also throughout my life developed good soft skills and I am a capable leader.
